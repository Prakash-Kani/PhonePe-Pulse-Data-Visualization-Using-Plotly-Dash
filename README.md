# ETL Process for PhonePe Pulse Data Extraction

In this ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, we outline the steps involved in extracting and managing data from PhonePe Pulse. Here's the breakdown:

## 1. Data Extraction
- We initiate the process by fetching the required PhonePe Pulse data from its GitHub repository using `git clone`. This data includes quarter-wise total information and state-wise quarter data in JSON format.

## 2. Data Transformation
- Once we have the data, we enter the "Transformation" phase. Here, we carefully parse and structure the extracted data, converting it into DataFrame format to make it more manageable and user-friendly.

## 3. Data Migration to SQL
- After the transformation, the data is prepared for storage. We migrate this valuable data to a SQL database for efficient storage and further analysis.

This ETL process simplifies the extraction and management of PhonePe Pulse data, ensuring it's readily available for analysis and insights.


# Exploration and Data Analysis Process and Framework

This documentation outlines the process and framework for exploring and analyzing data using MySQL, visualizations like geo-maps, bar charts, statistics, and a user-friendly dashboard created with Plotly Dash.

## 1. Access MySQL Database
- **Objective:** Establish a connection to the MySQL server and access the designated MySQL database using the MySQL Connector.
- **Description:** In this phase, we set up a connection to the MySQL server and navigate through the database tables. This step is crucial to access the data we need for analysis.

## 2. Data Filtering
- **Objective:** Refine and manipulate the collected data from the tables based on specified requirements through SQL queries. Transform this processed data into a DataFrame format.
- **Description:** In this step, we apply SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and prepare the data for analysis. The refined data is transformed into a DataFrame for further processing.

## 3. Visual Representation
- **Objective:** Conclude by constructing a user-friendly dashboard with Plotly Dash.
- **Description:** We create an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash, which includes features such as a dropdown menu to choose specific analysis questions. Users can select a question from the menu to analyze the data. The results are presented in both a DataFrame Table and a Bar Chart for clear visual representation.

This framework simplifies the process of exploring and analyzing data from a MySQL database, offering an intuitive and interactive dashboard for data-driven insights.


# PhonePe Pulse Dashboard User Guide

The PhonePe Pulse Dashboard is designed to provide an interactive platform for exploring and analyzing data from PhonePe Pulse, offering insights into both transaction and user data. The dashboard is organized into three main tabs: "Home," "Explore Data," and "Analysis."

## Home
- **Overview:** The "Home" tab provides an introduction and overview of the PhonePe Pulse data and the purpose of the dashboard.
- **My Dashboard:** This section offers a brief description of the dashboard and its functionalities.

## Explore Data
- **Overview:** In the "Explore Data" tab, you'll find two primary sections: "Transaction" and "User."
  
### Transaction
- **Input Sidebar:** This section contains inputs and filters that allow you to customize your analysis.
- **Main Column:** Here, you'll find figures and visualizations related to PhonePe Pulse transaction data.
- **Analysis :** The "Transaction" section includes figures and statistical analysis specific to transaction data.

### User
- **Input Sidebar:** Similar to the "Transaction" section, the "User" section provides inputs and filters for customizing the analysis.
- **Main Column:** Figures and visualizations are presented for analyzing PhonePe Pulse user data.
- **Analysis:** In the "User" section, you can explore figures and statistical analysis specific to user data.

## Analysis
- **Overview:** The "Analysis" tab allows you to perform time-based analysis, offering two options: "Day" and "Month."
  
### Day
- **Analysis:** This option provides an approximately daily analysis of PhonePe Pulse data. You can explore insights for a particular day.

### Month
- **Analysis:** By selecting "Month," you can perform an approximately monthly analysis, providing insights over a broader time frame.

This dashboard simplifies the process of exploring and analyzing PhonePe Pulse data, offering flexibility in the type of analysis and the time frame you want to investigate.
